This mod adds new faster and improved machines, bigger storage and faster belts. <br/>
Things this mod adds to your game:
- Smelter Mk.II that smelts 1.5 times faster than Mk.I. Plane Smelter becomes Smelter Mk.III and smelts items 2 times faster than Mk.I
- Chemical Plant Mk.II and Mk.III, which process items 1.5 and 2 times faster than Mk.I version.
- Storage Mk.III and Mk.IV which can store 120 and 180 stacks of items.
- Liquid Tank Mk.II and Mk.III which store 30k and 60k units of liquids.
- Conveyor belt Mk.IV with whopping speed of 60/s (In game you will see 72/s, but due to belt implementation specifics you will only be able to utilize 60/s of throughput)
- Customize Assembler Mk.II and Mk.III assembling speed.

All of the machines above can have their parameters customized to your liking in the config file located at `Dyson Sphere Program/BepInEx/config/`.

If you are looking for more custom content, like new tiers of machines you should check out [AdvancedMiner](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/kremnev8/AdvancedMiner/) and [GigaStations](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/kremnev8/GigaStationsUpdated/)

## Feedback, Bug Report and More 
More features might come in the future. I want to add more machines in the future, however creating custom models for machines is hard. It would greatly help if people skilled at 3D modeling and texturing for video-games would be willing to help to create assets.
Feel free to contact me via Discord (Kremnev8#3756) for any feedback, bug-reports or suggestions.

This mod should be compatible with [Galactic Scale 2](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/Galactic_Scale/GalacticScale/)<br/>
This mod is fully compatible with [Nebula Multiplayer Mod](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/nebula/NebulaMultiplayerMod/)<br/>
